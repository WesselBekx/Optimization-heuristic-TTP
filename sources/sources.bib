    abstract = {The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it explores the issue of producing valid, compact round-robin sports schedules by considering the problem as one of graph colouring. Using this model, which can also be extended to incorporate additional constraints, the difficulty of such problems is then gauged by considering the performance of a number of different graph colouring algorithms. Second, neighbourhood operators are then proposed that can be derived from the underlying graph colouring model and, in an example application, we show how these operators can be used in conjunction with multi-objective optimisation techniques to produce high-quality solutions to a real-world sports league scheduling problem encountered at the Welsh Rugby Union in Cardiff, Wales.}
